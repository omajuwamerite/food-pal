# System Architecture – Foodpal

## Overview
Foodpal follows a three-tier architecture consisting of the frontend, backend, and database layers. The system is built to handle real-time data updates and provide fast, reliable access to market information.

## Frontend
- **Technology:** React.js (or Flutter for mobile)
- **Purpose:** Displays data on food prices, charts, and comparisons.
- **Communication:** Sends REST API requests to the backend using HTTPS.
- **Hosting:** Netlify or Firebase Hosting.

## Backend
- **Technology:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Purpose:** Handles data requests, business logic, and user management.
- **APIs:** RESTful APIs for fetching and posting market price data.
- **Integration:** Connects with external data sources or admin upload portals.

## Database
- **Technology:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Purpose:** Stores user profiles, product data, and historical price records.
- **Structure:** 
  - Users Collection  
  - FoodItems Collection  
  - PriceHistory Collection  

## Data Flow
1. The user opens the app and requests data.  
2. The frontend sends the request to the backend API.  
3. The backend retrieves or updates data from MongoDB.  
4. The processed data is returned to the frontend for display.  

## Feasibility
The stack is lightweight, scalable, and commonly used for data-driven web apps. Each layer can be updated independently, making it flexible for future feature expansion.
